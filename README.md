# AI-papers

This repository contains a list of papers as discussed on my blog series on Medium.
https://medium.com/@rupak.thakur/23-deep-learning-papers-to-get-you-started-part-1-308f80d7bba2.
It also contains additional research papers which I found useful during my DL journey.

1. A Few Useful Things to know about Machine Learning - Pedro Domingos : A very useful paper summarizing all the key learnings from an ML standpoint.

2. Introduction to CNNs : An article, pretty different from a conventional paper, but provides a comprehensive explanation through mathematical concepts and derivations of basic CNN elements

3. Visualizing and Understanding CNNs - Zeiler and Fergus : Landmark paper in the history of deep learning. This opened up the doors to building more interpretable and easily explained deep learning models.

4. Convolutional Neural Networks - LeCun, Bengio : Introductory paper by LeCun and Bengio on CNNs

5. Efficient Backprop - Yann LeCun : Research paper by Prof. LeCun introducing backpropagation as a means to update parameters in DNNs

6. Understanding CNNs with a Mathematical Model - Kuo et al. : A completely mathematical take on CNNs, replete with equations and derivations

7. Understanding the Effective Receptive Field in Deep CNNs - Luo, Urtasun et al. : Discussion on receptive fields in CNNs and the impact of different functions, techniques etc. on them
